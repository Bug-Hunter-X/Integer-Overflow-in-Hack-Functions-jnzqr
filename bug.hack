function foo(x: int): int {  return x + 1; } function bar(x: int): int {  return foo(x) * 2; } function baz(x: int): int {  return bar(x) - 1; }  /* This is a valid Hack program. However, there is a potential bug if the input is very large. If x is larger than INT_MAX / 2, then the result of foo(x) will overflow, which will lead to undefined behavior. The same is true for bar(x) and baz(x). */
